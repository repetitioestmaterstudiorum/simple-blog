## getting started (locally)

-   git pull this repo
-   run `npm i` in /webapp and /server
-   run `docker-compose up` to develop in docker
-   (or go to /server folder and run `npm run dev`)

## sample data

-   some sample data is in the src/sample-data folder, but more can be generated by typing `node src/sample-data-generators.js` if needed
-   I'm aware that this is over-engineered. That's why I did not import this file in the code base. I had fun with sample data generation :)

## testing

### backend

-   go to the /server folder and run `npm test` -> this will start unit tests
-   only db.js is tested for now

### frontend

-go to the /webapp folder and run `npm test`

I only wrote one unit test here. I think it would make more sense to use Cypress or something similar to do end-to-end testing for the frontend.

## project decisions

### tech

-   the webapp (frontend) uses CRA
-   the backend is custom
-   useContext for state management in React
-   lexical closure approach (constants file) in the backend for data driven development

### misc

-   nodemon is used in production for simplicity (pm2 would be a better choice for a production project)
-   no reverse proxy is used for this demo app (nginx would be good for a production project)
-   CSS normalize is used, and Bootstrap (without React-Bootstrap) for minimal styling
